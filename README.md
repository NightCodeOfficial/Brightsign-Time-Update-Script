# BrightSign Time Updater

This script helps you update the time on your BrightSign device using the system's current date and time. It generates JavaScript code that can be pasted into your browser's console to synchronize the time on your BrightSign player.

This script is for cases in which you are able to log into the BrightSign diagnostic webserver, but unable to update the time (the clock icon beside the current time does not appear.) If the time settings on the player are incorrect, scheduled presentations will not display correctly. This issue is especially relevant when the player has been powered down for a long period of time as its internal time settings reset. The javascript code generated by running this python file will allow you to set the player time to your system time. 

## Features

- Automatically fetches the current system date and time.
- Generates JavaScript code for quick time updates.
- Copies the generated code to your clipboard for easy execution.
- Lightweight and user-friendly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pyperclip` library for clipboard functionality

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   `
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   `

## Usage

1. Open your browser, log in to the BrightSign player

2. Run the script:
   `
   python time_update_script_generator.py
   `

3. Enter the IP address of your BrightSign player when prompted:

4. The script will:
   - Fetch the current date and time from your system.
   - Generate JavaScript code to update the time on your BrightSign device.
   - Copy the JavaScript code to your clipboard.
   
5. Open the console in your browser 
   - Chrome `ctrl+shift+j`
   - Firefox `ctrl + shift + k`


## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the generated JavaScript code:
```javascript
fetch('http://192.168.0.101/api/v1/time', {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        date: '2025-01-01',
        time: '12:45',
        applyTimezone: true
    })
})
.then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
        console.log('Time updated successfully!');
        return response.json();
    } else {
        console.error('Failed to update time:', response.status);
        return response.text().then(text => { throw new Error(text) });
    }
})
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the IP address provided matches your BrightSign player's IP.
- The script assumes your system time and timezone are correctly configured.
- If clipboard functionality fails, the script will display the JavaScript code for manual copying.
